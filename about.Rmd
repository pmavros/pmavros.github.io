I am an Asistant Professor of Applied Psychology Design and Digital Technologies at [Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris](telecom-paris.fr/). I work at the intersection of design (architectural, urban), spatial cognition research and environmental (neuro)psychology.

## Bio

Before moving to Paris, I was post-doctoral researcher at the [Future Cities Laboratory](www.fcl.ethz.ch) of the [Singapore-ETH Centre](www.sec.ethz.ch).  
I hold a PhD on Advanced Spatial Analysis from the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), The Bartlett, University College London (UCL), studied Digital Media and Culture at the University of Edinburgh and Archicture Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).
