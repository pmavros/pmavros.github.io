Hi there! 
</p>
I am an architecturally-trained spatial cognition scientist living in Singapore. Currently I work as a senior post-doctoral researcher at the [Future Cities Laboratory (FCL)](https://fcl.ethz.ch/people/Researchers/PanagiotisMavros.html) of the Singapore-ETH Centre and the Chair of Cognitive Science, ETH ZÃ¼rich. I love talking about cities, urban design, navigation, and cycling.
